    <h4>Crust Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>        
    </ul>

    <h4>Filling Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>2 lemons, juiced</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To make the crust: Blend 2 cups flour, softened butter, and 1/2 cup sugar in a medium bowl until well combined; press into the bottom of an ungreased 9x13-inch pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top is dry and edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan,
            about 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool briefly before frosting.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until firm and golden, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling: Whisk remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1/4 cup flour in a medium bowl. Whisk in eggs, then lemon juice until smooth; pour filling over the baked crust.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Set the pan aside to cool completely; the bars will firm up as they cool. When cooled, cut into uniform squares.</li>
    </ol>
